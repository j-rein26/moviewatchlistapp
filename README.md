# The App

This is a simple consule based app that allowed me to practice setting up a database using sqlite. It asks the user to input a number when making a choice. 
It also supports multiple users. I hope to build out a frontend in time. Below is an example of the choices the user has. 

1) Add new movie.
2) View upcoming movies
3) View all movies
4) Watch a movie
5) View watched movies
6) Add user
7) Search for a movie
8) Exit
